# Runs INSIDE the GUI test container (started by driver.sh), never on the host.
# Starts the AppImage and records, in an events file, the exit status of that first instance and
# of the instance the updater relaunches. The relaunch is spawned by the app as
# `sh -c 'while kill -0 PID; ...; exec APPIMAGE ARGS'` and is orphaned when the first instance
# exits; as child subreaper this process inherits it, so its real exit status can be reaped here.
# Events (one per line): first_pid=, first_exit=RC, relaunch_pid=, relaunch_cmd=ARGV,
# relaunch_exit=RC, done. RC is the exit code, or -SIGNAL when killed by a signal.
